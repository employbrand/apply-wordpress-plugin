# Wordpress Employbrand Apply plugin

Install this plugin and configure the plugin by adding the API credentials from Employbrand Apply (view the settings).

## How it works
All environments and vacancies will be synced to Wordpress as posts. Each environment type is a post type.

To use the variables as meta data you can use the variable name from Apply, and add a underscore as prefix. 

The dropdown field will generate two meta keys. The first is the display name, the second (suffix _key) is the stored key.
